# GOES Real-Time Flare Trigger Algorithm

### ELSA GUI

ELSA includes plots that directly relate to the GOES Trigger. These include GOES XRSA and XRSB, GOES Temperature, GOES Emission Measure, and the EVE ESP 0-7 nm data, which is included to provide a proxy for lower-latency GOES. The EVE data is also scaled to GOES values and plotted on the GOES XRS plot. 

**When Running for Flare Campaign**
  *If ELSA triggers, follow Julie's instructions for the launch/hold process. 
  *If FOXSI/HIC decide to hold, wait until the trigger condition is no longer being met, and then press "Not Launching" to move back to the searching state.
  *If FOXSI/HIC decide to launch, go and watch the launch!! :D 

**When Running Trials:**
  *If ELSA triggers, decide if you would like to start the countdown. When starting the countdown, set a timer for 3 minutes and hit the "Start Countdown" button when you begin to save that time. 
  *When the countdown is up, you must decide whether to launch or hold. If launching, press the "Launching Now" button. This will move the ELSA into the launched state. Sit back and watch your flare!
  *If you decide to hold, press the "Not Launching" button. This will move ELSA back into a searching state. You will not incur a 30-minute deadtime, as that feature was removed for the campaign. If the trigger condition is met after holding, ignore the trigger until the trigger condition is no longer being met, and then press "Not Launching" again.

### ANNA GUI

ANNA includes complimentary plots that are not included in the trigger. This includes EOVSA, EVE 30nm, 10s differences in EVE 0-7nm and 1-min differences in XRSB. ANNA will be run in-tandem with ELSA during the campaign.
